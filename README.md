# GranularRotatDrum

This code is for simulating the dynamics of granular materials in a rotating drum.

In this practice, we use a library called Mechsys (http://mechsys.nongnu.org/)

rotatdrum.cpp contains everything about the setup of the granular packing, and parameters associated with the drum.

rotatdrum.inp is the input file

Once built, use the following command to run ./rotatdrum rotatdrum 14 where 14 is the number of threads we are going to use.
